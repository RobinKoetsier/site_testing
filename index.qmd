### Welcome!!

My name is Robin Koetsier. This site serves as a personal site for my data and blog posts. 

I mostly write/visualize stuff about Dutch football. On my Twitter profile you can follow me for visualizations of Eredivisie matches and other stuff. I will update the Eredivisie stats after every matchday. Below you can check all my posts combined. In the menu they are divided by what kind of post it is. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# list names of post folders
posts <- list.dirs(
  path = here::here("posts"),
  full.names = FALSE,
  recursive = FALSE
)

# extract the slugs
slugs <- gsub("^.*_", "", posts)

# lines to insert to a netlify _redirect file
redirects <- paste0("/", slugs, " ", "/posts/", posts)

# write the _redirect file
writeLines(redirects, here::here("_site", "_redirects"))
```
