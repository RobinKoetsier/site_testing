This site serves as a personal site for my data and blog posts. \n\nI mostly write/visualize stuff about Dutch football. On my Twitter profile you can follow me for visualizations of Eredivisie matches and other stuff. I will update the Eredivisie stats after every matchday. Below you can check all my posts combined. In the menu they are divided by what kind of post it is. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br> <br> <br>\n\n\n",
